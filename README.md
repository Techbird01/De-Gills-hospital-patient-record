Patient Health Trends: 
Tool- Power BI

As part of an internal review at De Gill's Hospital, I had the opportunity to work with a health analysis dashboard built from anonymized patient data.

Key Patient Insights:
1. Lifestyle Behaviors Show a Gender Bias

Alcohol consumption is significantly higher among male patients (287 cases) than females (194).

Smoking follows a similar trend, with men accounting for 53% of smokers and women 47%. This difference, while smaller, is still notable given its impact on long-term health outcomes like cancer and respiratory diseases.

2. Mental Health Pressures Are High in Older Age Groups

The age group 64 shows the highest anxiety incidence, followed by patients aged 62 and 63.

Interestingly, peer pressure—typically associated with younger demographics—shows elevated scores among patients aged 64 (32), 56 (28), and 62 (27). This could indicate emotional or social stress factors affecting health behaviors later in life.

3. Cancer Prevalence Remains High and Gender- Balanced 
The split between men and women is relatively balanced, with men slightly more affected. This reinforces the importance of universal preventive care, regardless of gender.

4. Physical Indicators Reflect Early Warning Signs

Yellow fingers, often associated with heavy smoking, spike in older age groups, especially age 64. This can be a visual cue for early intervention in patients who may not self-report smoking habits.

Chronic conditions are manageable for most, with a maximum of 2 chronic illnesses per patient in the dataset. Similarly, fatigue-related complaints cap out at 2, which may reflect underreporting or successful case management.

Why This Matters
These insights underscore the value of combining behavioral, psychological, and clinical indicators to get a fuller picture of patient health. It's not just about diagnosing diseases—it's about understanding the context around them.

For example:

Interventions targeting male patients may benefit from focusing on addiction counseling and preventive screenings.

The rising mental health strain on older adults—especially in relation to social pressure—deserves more attention in both public health messaging and hospital resource allocation.

A data-driven approach to early visual symptoms like yellow fingers can improve detection and engagement with patients who may avoid clinical discussions about smoking or fatigue.

What We Can Do Next
Based on this dashboard:

Expand mental health screenings to include patients over 60.

Tailor health communication strategies to address gendered patterns in alcohol and tobacco use.

Use clear visual cues (like yellow fingers) as flags in routine checkups.

Explore why peer pressure remains high among older adults—this might be cultural, economic, or social.
